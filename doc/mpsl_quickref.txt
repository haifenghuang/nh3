 MPSL Quick Reference

 Scalars

v = 10000;		Integer assignation
v = 3.1416;		Real numbers
v = 'string1';		Verbatim strings
w = "string2\n";	Strings with escape codes (see below)
l = size(v);		Size of v (7)

 Arrays

a = [];			Empty array
a = [ 100, "hi!",	Array assignation (showing
    3.1416, "yo!" ];	elements with assorted types)
w = [ 1, [], a ];	Array elements can also be arrays,
			hashes or anything (as non-scalar
			values are always passed by reference)
v = a[0];		First element of a (100)
a[0] = 200;		Assignment of first element of a
l = size(a);		Number of elements in a (4)
x = a;			x holds the same array as a
x[0] = 6;		a[0] is also 6
y = clone(a);		y holds a clone of a
y[0] = 9;		a[0] is NOT 9
v = a[-1];		Last element of a ("yo!")
w = [1 .. 100];		Range (array of 100 elements)
push(a, 6543);		Add element to the end of a
l = size(a);		It's now 5
v = pop(a);		Deletes last element (and returns it)
l = size(a);		Back to 4
ains(a, 'heh', 1);	Inserts 'heh' at offset 1, all
			existing elements moved up
l = size(a);		It's again 5
v = adel(a, 1);		Deletes element at offset 1 (and
			returns it), all existing elements
			moved down
l = size(a);		It's again 4

 Hashes

h = {};			Empty hash
h = { 'key1' => "val1",	Hash assignation (showing elements
  'key2' => 1000,	with assorted types). Hash elements
  'key3' => [ 1, 2 ] };	can be anything
v = h['key1'];		Value for 'key1' ('val1')
h['key4'] = 3000;	Assignment of key 'key4' with 3000
p = hsize(h);		Number of pairs in h (5)
i = h;			i holds the same hash as h
i['key1'] = 4321;	h['key1'] is also 4321
j = clone(h);		j holds a clone of h
j['key1'] = 8765;	h['key1'] is NOT 8765
v = h.key3.1;		Abridged mode (same as v = h['key3'][1])
h.key3.1 = 10;		Abridged mode assignation
a = keys(h);		Keys of h (['key1','key2','key3','key4'])

 Subroutines

sub greeting {		Subroutine definition
   print("Hello!\n");
}
greeting();		Subroutine call (prints Hello!)
sub sum(a, b) {		Subroutine definition, with
   return(a + b);	arguments.
}
v = sub(10, 20);	Subroutine call with arguments
			(sets v to 30).
s = sub { return 3; };	Anonymous subroutine (assigned
			to s)
s = sub(a) { print a;};	Anonymous subroutine, with
			arguments
s = greeting;		Without parenthesis, assigns
			a pointer to the subroutine
s();			Prints Hello!

 Control operators

if(expr) {		If expr is true, execute list 1
   statement list 1;	(braces can be omitted if
}			list 1 is one statement)
else {			otherwise, execute list 2
   statement list 2;	(else is also optional)
}
while(expr) {		While expr is true, execute list
   statement list;	(braces can be omitted if
}			list is one statement)
foreach(v, a) {		Iterate the array a, assigning
   statement list;	each element to v and executing
}			list
break;			Exits loop in while and foreach

 String escapes for double quotes

\n			Newline
\t			Tab
\r			Carriage return
\e			Escape
\"			Double quotes
\\			Backslash
