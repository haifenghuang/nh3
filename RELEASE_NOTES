MPSL Release Notes
==================

1.0.4
-----

 * The iterator variable in foreach() is _always_ created
   as a local variable inside the block.

1.0.3
-----

 * Anonymous subroutines now run inside a block frame
   instead of a subroutine frame. This way, they can have
   access to local variables defined in the subroutine
   they are called from. So, for example, if you run
   map() inside a subroutine, its anonymous code block
   can access the local variables defined there.
 * getenv() doesn't crash if the environment variable
   does not exist.

1.0.2
-----

 * Small internal refactoring regarding subroutine and
   block frames. Frame creation code has been unified,
   so block frames don't crash when a NULL local symbol
   table is sent as argument, and can have arguments.
   This change is not visible from outside; only a step
   towards closing bug #1107.
