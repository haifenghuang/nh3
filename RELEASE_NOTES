MPSL Release Notes
==================

1.0.9
-----

 * New operands &=, |= and ^=.
 * New syntax for _inverse_ calling functions: the new
   construction `val1->func(val2)' is equivalent
   to `func(val1, val2)'. This way, chained function
   calls where the first argument of one is the return
   of the other are much easier to understand.
 * Numbers prefixed by 0b are accepted as binary numbers.

1.0.8
-----

 * New function `sscanf()'.
 * New function `compile()', to compile a string of MPSL code
   to an executable value.
 * New function `bincall()', to create an executable value
   given a pointer to binary code.
 * The `mpsl' executable now ignores the first line of an MPSL
   script if it starts with #!.
 * Real numbers can be expressed in scientific notation.

1.0.7
-----

 * The `write()' allows a variable argument of values to write.
 * Values are dumped as MPSL instead of MPDM's low-level format.
 * New function `chdir()'.

1.0.6
-----

 * Fixed a strange but annoying bug regarding local variables
   losing their values in anonymous subroutines.

1.0.5
-----

 * New `g' flag in regex().
 * Fix backslash parsing in strings.

1.0.4
-----

 * The iterator variable in foreach() is _always_ created
   as a local variable inside the block. Also, the old
   construction foreach(local v, ...) issues a warning,
   as it's redundant.

1.0.3
-----

 * Anonymous subroutines now run inside a block frame
   instead of a subroutine frame. This way, they can have
   access to local variables defined in the subroutine
   they are called from. So, for example, if you run
   map() inside a subroutine, its anonymous code block
   can access the local variables defined there.
 * getenv() doesn't crash if the environment variable
   does not exist.

1.0.2
-----

 * Small internal refactoring regarding subroutine and
   block frames. Frame creation code has been unified,
   so block frames don't crash when a NULL local symbol
   table is sent as argument, and can have arguments.
   This change is not visible from outside; only a step
   towards closing bug #1107.
