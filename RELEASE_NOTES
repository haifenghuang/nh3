MPSL Release Notes
==================

1.0.2
-----

 * Small internal refactoring regarding subroutine and
   block frames. Frame creation code has been unified,
   so block frames don't crash when a NULL local symbol
   table is sent as argument, and can have arguments.
   This change is not visible from outside; only a step
   towards closing bug #1107.
