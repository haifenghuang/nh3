nh3 Programming Language
========================

nh3 is a general purpose programming language. It was original conceived
as the 3.x version of the MPSL [1] programming language, but finally
diverged too much from the original, so a new project name was deemed
necessary and `nh3' given as a meaningless acronym (just keeping the "3"
in the name). Some concepts and dependencies from the parent source
(like e.g. depending on the MPDM [2] library) were kept, though.

This project is still in development and it's a moving target. Deep
changes may happen that break everything. Use it at your own risk.
