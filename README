Minimum Profit Scripting Language (MPSL)
========================================

MPSL (Minimum Profit Scripting Language) is a programming language
concieved as a scripting engine for the Minimum Profit Text Editor,
though it can also be used as a general-purpose programming tool.

This is the 3.x source code branch. It's a development, unstable
version where everything is subject to change or break. If you
need to build the Minimum Profit Text Editor (upto versions 5.2.x),
you need the 2.x branch.
