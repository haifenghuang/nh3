TODO
====

 * In the 'persistent hashes' or 'disk hashes', add a fallthrough basic
   driver that stores the hash in disk as a text file, but works as a
   normal hash in any other case. The hash will be dumped to disk on
   destroy time. But a problem arises: that hash (and any dbm hash, by
   the way) will probably never be destroyed unless at exit ALL values are.
   Add a flag (DESTROY) and an atexit() function that travels the list
   of values and destroys all of them (even ignoring the reference count).
 * Beyond ties: suppress all flags (except some internal ones as IVAL
   or EXEC). Everything should be done with ties; for example, there
   should exist a _CMP tie function that would be executed when two
   values being compared have the same tie (or, better, the same _CMP
   function). Specially, MPDM_STRING and MPDM_MULTIPLE should disappear.
   A value will be assumed multiple when having a tie function _AEXPAND
   (or _AGET, or so). Code will become incidentally clean (no more "if
   flags & MPDM_" scattered through the code). Risky change!
 * Create a tie function for mpdm_dump().
 * Create some versions of functions that avoid doing boundary checks
   when redundant (example: calls to mpdm_aset() in mpdm_acollapse()).
 * Should ties be in a special source file, mpdm_t.c ?
 * stat(), chmod(), bread(), bwrite().

The scripting language
----------------------

 * Find a name (mpsl?).
 * Will it be included here, or as a separated package? it could poison
   the mpdm concept as a 'low level utility library'.

Using mpdm elsewhere
--------------------

 * Of course, mp-4.
 * ahxm.
