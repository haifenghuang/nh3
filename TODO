TODO
====

 * Create a tie function for mpdm_dump().
 * Create some versions of functions that avoid doing boundary checks
   when redundant (example: calls to mpdm_aset() in mpdm_acollapse()).
 * All string management should be done in wchar_t.
 * Should ties be in a special source file, mpdm_t.c ?
 * stat(), chmod(), bread(), bwrite().

The scripting language
----------------------

 * Find a name (mpsl?).
 * Will it be included here, or as a separated package? it could poison
   the mpdm concept as a 'low level utility library'.

Using mpdm elsewhere
--------------------

 * Of course, mp-4.
 * ahxm.
