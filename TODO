Pending Enhancements
--------------------

 * 1003: Beyond ties; suppress all flags (except some internal ones as IVAL
   or EXEC). Everything should be done with ties; for example, there
   should exist a _CMP tie function that would be executed when two
   values being compared have the same tie (or, better, the same _CMP
   function). Specially, MPDM_STRING and MPDM_MULTIPLE should disappear.
   A value will be assumed multiple when having a tie function _AEXPAND
   (or _AGET, or so). Code will become incidentally clean (no more "if
   flags & MPDM_" scattered through the code). Risky change!
 * 1004: Create a tie function for mpdm_dump().
 * 1005: Should ties be in a special source file, mpdm_t.c ?
 * 1006: stat()
 * 1007: chmod()
 * 1008: bread()
 * 1009: bwrite()
 * 1010: Find a name for the scripting language (mpsl?).
 * 1011: Will the scripting language be included here, or as a
   separated package? it could poison the mpdm concept as a 'low
   level utility library'.
 * 1015: The auto-sweep introduced by _mpdm.high_threshold is
   extremely unsafe. At least, internal parts of mpdm should be
   autosweep-safe.
 * 1016: Add optional iconv support.
 * 1017: Add optional gettext support.
 * 1018: Support for optional features (like gdbm) should be stored
   in an mpdm array or hash to easily ask for capabilities.

Closed
------

 * 1000: All string operations should use wchar_t instead of char
   (closed by: #1001) (Sat, 3 Jul 2004 11:14:00 +0200).
 * 1001: Merge mpdm-branch-wchar (Closes: #1000)
   (Sun, 4 Jul 2004 11:06:00 +0200).
 * 1002: mpdm_aget() and mpdm_aset() should accept negative offsets
   (Mon, 12 Jul 2004 17:44:00 +0200).
 * 1012: mpdm_startup() and mpdm_shutdown() (Thu, 26 Aug 2004 20:10:02 +0200)
 * 1013: Move the hardwired '16' number of minimum elements to an
   struct _mpdm element, set from mpdm_startup()
   (Thu, 26 Aug 2004 20:10:18 +0200)
 * 1014: Create a new high threshold for values, to force calling
   mpdm_sweep() from mpdm_new() if that threshold is overpassed (this
   will allow a limit to be imposed to the number of unreferenced
   values) (Thu, 26 Aug 2004 20:26:21 +0200).
