Open Bugs
---------

None!

Pending Enhancements
--------------------

 * 1024: Implement the 'continue' directive in mpsl.

Closed
------

 * 1011: Will the scripting language be included here, or as a
   separated package? it could poison the mpdm concept as a 'low
   level utility library' (Yes; Wed, 08 Dec 2004 09:51:55 +0100).
 * 1010: Find a name for the scripting language (Mpsl should be
   fine; Wed, 08 Dec 2004 09:52:32 +0100).
 * 1021: Merge mpsl (the scripting language) lex and yacc files from
   CVS project filp2 (Thu, 09 Dec 2004 11:55:42 +0100).
 * 1034: Implement ++ and -- (Tue, 14 Dec 2004 12:15:25 +0100).
 * 1035: Implement +=, -=, *=, /= (Tue, 14 Dec 2004 12:15:28 +0100).
 * 1036: Implement the 'local' variable creation in mpsl.
   (Tue, 14 Dec 2004 13:06:53 +0100).
 * 1038: Implement the '&&' and '||' boolean operands
   (Wed, 15 Dec 2004 17:02:12 +0100).
 * 1039: SUB_PREFIX and SUB_POSTFIX should be only one instruction,
   that create the prefix / execute things / destroy the prefix,
   instead of two (Thu, 16 Dec 2004 09:08:38 +0100).
 * 1040: MPSL_OP_SYMNAM (SYMBOL) should not exist; it should just
   be a MPSL_OP_LIST (Fri, 17 Dec 2004 07:49:10 +0100).
 * 1041: MPSL_OP_SYMLIST (SYMLIST) should not exist, and be just
   a MPSL_OP_LIST. Also, it should have only one argument
   with the list of symbols, and not an undefined number or arguments.
   (Fri, 24 Dec 2004 18:26:26 +0100).
 * 1042: The local t = v instruction is very buggy; it should be
   implemented as a ';' instruction with the local and the assignation
   part and the arguments to LOCAL and to '=' should be instructions and
   not values (Fri, 24 Dec 2004 18:49:29 +0100).
 * 1046: Subroutine definitions are using MPSL_OP_SUB that is
   really the substract opcode (Sun, 26 Dec 2004 19:26:32 +0100).
 * 1022: Implement return values for mpsl functions (Closed by #1052;
   Sat, 08 Jan 2005 21:30:37 +0100).
 * 1049: Multiple instructions are buggy; they should always have
   two arguments (Though the parser now spits 18 shift/reduce conflicts,
   everything seems to be fine; Sat, 08 Jan 2005 21:32:57 +0100).
 * 1055: Implement the 'FOREACH' opcode (Sun, 06 Feb 2005 17:31:55 +0100).
 * 1053: Implement the 'RANGE' opcode (Sun, 06 Feb 2005 17:55:04 +0100).
 * 1056: Add c-style strings (\n, \t, etc) (Mon, 07 Feb 2005 19:22:50 +0100).
 * 1057: Add a mpsl_compile_file() function (Mon, 21 Feb 2005 18:31:13 +0100).
 * 1060: Though local symbol names must be single to the
   parser, they need to be accesible / assignable as
   complex values with mpdm_sget() / mpdm_sset()
   (Wed, 23 Feb 2005 08:20:51 +0100).
